# CMOS-CS-AMPLIFIER-DESIGN
Understanding the Gain of a Common Source Amplifier by analysing the circuit and varying different parameters such as w/l ,Rd etc.

We analyse a common source amplifier with a passive resistor load. We calculate the gain of the circuit and then analyse variation in gain by changing different
parameters.
